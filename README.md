# brantley-designs
This website features the artwork and life of Megan Brantley. It showcases a portfolio and also tells about the artist and her life.

I, Megan Brantley, focused on the design of the site while my partner, Lora Hill, worked on fixing bugs, making the website responsive, and working on the general makeup rather than the design. I created most of the layouts for the pages, chose color schemes, found backgrounds, etc.

While our website does work across multiple platforms, we could have made it look even better with more time. However, we both seem to be happy with the end result.

We hope you enjoy Megan's artwork as well as the website we have created for this project.
